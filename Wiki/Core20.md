## consideration about .NET core migration

- Topshelf is not migrated, we can use a class from alessandro
- Metrics.NET was not migrated, but we have another porting that was ported [hq-io](https://github.com/hq-io/metrics/tree/master/src/hq.metrics) we should check if it works 
- Fasterflect was not migrated, that could be annoying.

## Libraries to update

- Log4net should be moved to latest version
- CAstle should be moved to latest version
- All nunit tests should be moved to NUNIT3.
